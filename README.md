This is a project for test task from company Be Poland Think, Solve &amp; Execute

Roman Petruchyk - Zadanie Front-end BePoland

1. This code has a possibility to upload only 1 photo (no multiple file option) - I hope it is how it should be
2. There is only "Upload file" button - no drag&drop. As far as i understand it's an optional functionality => 
"tylko ładowanie plików poprzez element input[type=file] lub obszar drag&drop" 
3. When you press "Delete button" -> photo and it's information is deleted. Map is still visible, but there is no marker 
and map is showing entire planet on zoom = 1 property. 
4. Code is not perfect, but I was trying to do all my best :) 

If you're checking this code => Have a wonderful day 😉❤️
